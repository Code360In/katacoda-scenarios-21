# Push Updated Code to Origin

If you remember when we pushed our code to origin the first time, we'll be doing the same thing again. Execute the command `git add README.md`{{executable}} to add our file to the staging area. Commit the change with `git commit -m 'Resolved conflict with enumerated list and grammatical error'`{{executable}}. Then finally push our updated code to origin by executing `git push origin master`{{executable}}. The origin should now be up to date and all that is left to do is finish our pull request.
