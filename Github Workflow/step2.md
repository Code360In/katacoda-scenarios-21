# Fork a Repo

In this step, you will learn how to create a fork of a public repo on GitHub. The work done in this step is done entirely in the web browser and you will not need to execute any commands from the terminal.

### What is a Fork?

A fork of a repo essentially creates a copy of the repository that you forked. This is your copy and you are free to make changes to this repo without it affecting the original repo.

### How to Fork

The link for the repo you will be working in is displayed in the terminal. Copy and paste the link to GitHub in your web browser and it will direct you to the page. In the top right corner of the screen you'll see a button that says 'Fork'. Click this button and select the account that you would like to fork the repo to.

After forking the moco-learn-git repo to your personal account, you're now ready to clone the repo to make local changes.
