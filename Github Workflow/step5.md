# Push to Orign

Our local repo is currently up to date with our code although our repos on GitHub are still outdated. This step will guide you through the process of updating 'origin'.

### Push

When we first cloned our forked repo from GitHub, Git automatically recognizes that repo as our 'origin'. This is convenient because we do not have to manually add the link to be registered as origin. To update our fork, we want to execute the command `git push origin grammar`{{execute}}. We have to specify the branch where we did our work at the end of the command or it will not execute. Our forked repo is now up to date, and we just have to merge our changes into our repo for the organization.
