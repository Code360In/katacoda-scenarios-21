# Make a Pull Request

Pull requests are very useful when working in a team of developers. They are a great way for your peers to revise your code before it is merged into 'upstream'. Upstream is what we use to refer to the parent repo that we originally forked from.

### Make the Pull Request

This step will be done through the web browser on GitHub. Go to your forked repo and in the middle of the screen you will see a message displayed that says 'grammar had recent pushes less than a minute ago' with a green button to the right of it that reads 'Compare & pull request'. Click the green button and you will be prompted with a screen to complete your pull request. At the top of the screen there are 4 boxes and an arrow that splits them in half. The first two box is the name of the repo you are making the pull request for and the second box is the branch in that repo. The third and fourth box is your personal repo and branch which are the changes you are trying to get approved. There is also a text box where you can add additional notes but this is optional. Now click the green button that says 'Create pull request' and your pull request is now made although there seems to be a conflict with your code and the code already approved to be in the main repo. The next step will guide you through solving this issue.
