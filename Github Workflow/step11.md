# Conclusion

The workflow that you learned is a very useful skill for you to be able to work in a team of developers, all collaborating on the same project. In this scenario, we discussed forking and cloning repos on GitHub, making changes to the code locally, pushing to GitHub, making a Pull Request, and how to resolve a conflict when merging your code to upstream.

You no longer need the forked repo that you have on GitHub so feel free to delete it. The upstream repo in the moco-learn-git organization will be deleted in 48 hours. If you would like to run through the scenario again, a new repo will be provided for you to work in.
