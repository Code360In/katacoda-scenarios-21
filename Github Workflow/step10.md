# Verify the Pull Request

The last step is to finish our pull request that you originally created. When you go back to the pull request through the repo in moco-learn-git, there should be a message that is displayed that says there are no conflicts with the base branch. You have successfully resolved the conflict. At this point all that is left is for someone else to merge your pull request and your work will then be accepted into the base branch.
