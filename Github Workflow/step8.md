# Resolve the Conflict

A great feature of GitHub is that they conveniently mark where the conflict was in the file. It is important to keep in mind that the conflict contains not only your code, but someone else's code. Your colleague's code has already gone through the review process and has been accepted into the main branch. Therefore, it is important to not disregard their implementation and only make your change. For this scenario, you want to go through and make sure the bullet points are changed to an enumerated list which takes care of the implementation that your peer had approved. Then, you want to make the grammatical change that your originally had made where 'Push' in number 5 is changed to 'push' and 'Pull Request' in number 6 is changed to 'pull request'. The conflict with the base branch has now been resolved and your code is now ready to go through the review process to be merged into the main branch.
